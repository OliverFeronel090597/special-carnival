**QtForge Studio** is an open-source developer tool for **hosting, testing, and hot-reloading Qt widgets** in a controlled runtime environment.

It allows developers to load renderers dynamically, run them inside either `QMainWindow` or `QWidget`, and validate UI behavior **without restarting the application**.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔁 Live renderer updates (hot-reload friendly)
* 🧩 Host-agnostic architecture (`QMainWindow` ↔ `QWidget`)
* 📦 Single renderer, multiple host testing
* 📊 Supports complex widgets (charts, layouts, controls)
* 🧪 Ideal for UI prototyping and renderer isolation
* 🪶 Lightweight and framework-agnostic

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

* Rapid Qt UI prototyping
* Renderer / widget isolation testing
* Plugin-style UI development
* Hot-reload workflows for Qt projects
* Internal tools and R&D environments

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Python 3.11+
* PyQt6 / PySide6
* Qt Charts (optional)
* MIT License

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install PyQt6 PyQt6-Charts
```

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OliverFeronel090597/special-carnival.git
cd QtForge\ Studio
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the test harness:

```bash
python main.py
```

Toggle between `QMainWindow` and `QWidget` hosts by changing a single flag in the code.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

QtForge Studio treats **renderers as pure widgets** and **windows as replaceable shells**.

If a widget cannot run outside a `QMainWindow`, it is not a renderer — it is a design flaw.
